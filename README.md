# Minesweeper

This is a project that I created to become more familiar in C# during my onboarding with Costar Group.

It's just Minesweeper that's playable in terminal, with features that allows:
- user to set number of rows, columns, and mines for the board
- select/flagging certain cells
- user to reset game
- user to show hidden/revealed board
- user to quit

Things that could be improved:
- Better mine placing algorithm, as well as first move logic to not create game states that are impossible/guesswork
- better flow and prettier outputs
